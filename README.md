## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Navidrome or Subsonic server** | Any recent version; OctoFiesta is optional — see [Server Setup](#server-setup) |
| **Android device** | Android 8.0+ (API 26+) |
| **iOS device** | iOS 15+ — sideload only via AltStore or Sideloadly |
| **Node.js** | ≥ 22.11.0 (see `.nvmrc`) |
| **JDK** | 21 (Temurin recommended) |
| **Android SDK** | 34 or 36 |
| **NDK** | 27.1 |

> You do **not** need a cloud account, API key, or internet access beyond your own server. Musonic uses the Deezer public API for artist images and recommendations — no registration required.

### Installation — Android

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DoodzProg/Musonic.git
cd Musonic

# 2. Switch to the correct Node version
nvm use          # reads .nvmrc (22.11.0)

# 3. Install JS dependencies
npm install

# 4. Connect your device and launch
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
npm start -- --reset-cache   # Terminal 1 — Metro bundler
npm run android               # Terminal 2
```

### Installation — iOS (macOS only)

```bash
bundle install
cd ios && bundle exec pod install && cd ..
npm run ios
```

---

## Server Setup

### Navidrome (standard)

Open Musonic, tap **Settings → Server**, and enter:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server URL | `https://your-navidrome-domain.tld` |
| Username | your Navidrome username |
| Password | your Navidrome password |

No additional configuration required. Musonic uses standard Subsonic API endpoints.

### OctoFiesta (optional)

[OctoFiesta](https://github.com/DoodzProg/octo-fiesta) is a Subsonic-compatible middleware layer that extends Navidrome with external catalog streaming. When Musonic is connected to an OctoFiesta instance, the Deezer-powered recommendation engine goes beyond surfacing discovery results — tracks, albums, and artists from the external catalog can be played directly alongside your personal library, with seamless ID routing handled transparently on both ends.

Configuration is identical to a standard Navidrome setup:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server URL | `https://your-octofiesta-domain.tld` |
| Username | your Navidrome username |
| Password | your Navidrome password |

Musonic handles `ext-deezer:` prefixed IDs automatically. Cover art, artist images, and stream URLs all resolve without any client-side configuration.

---

## CI/CD

Musonic uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases:

| Workflow | Trigger | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `android-release.yml` | Push tag `v*` or manual dispatch | Signed release APK |
| `ios-release.yml` | Push tag `v*` or manual dispatch | Unsigned IPA (AltStore / Sideloadly) |
| `ci.yml` | PR to `main` | TypeScript type check |

**Required GitHub Secrets** (Settings → Secrets → Actions):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded `musonic-release.keystore` |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | `musonic` |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Same as `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` (PKCS12) |

To trigger a release:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```

Both workflows fire automatically and attach the APK and IPA as assets on the GitHub Release.

---

## Building a Signed APK

```bash
# Ensure android/keystore.properties references your keystore (git-ignored)
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
# Output: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

> `musonic-release.keystore` and `android/keystore.properties` are git-ignored. Keep a secure offline backup of both files — they cannot be recovered if lost.

## Architecture Notes

### Audio Engine
React Native Track Player 4.1.2, patched for New Architecture (37 `scope.launch` fixes). `playerStore` is the UI source of truth; RNTP is the audio source of truth. `AudioPlayer.tsx` bridges RNTP events → store. The `isMagic` flag is preserved across queue operations via RNTP track metadata to ensure Shuffle Magic tracks render correctly after queue mutations.

### HTTP Client
All API calls use native `fetch` with `AbortController` for cancellation and `URLSearchParams` for query string construction. No third-party HTTP client.

### Offline & Downloads
`connectivityService` pings the server periodically and sets `isOfflineMode` in `settingsStore`. `playlistCacheStore` holds playlist metadata and song lists for offline access. `downloadStore` manages per-track file downloads with a semaphore (max 3 concurrent), MMKV persistence, and `getTotalSizeBytes()` for storage reporting. Only Navidrome-indexed tracks are downloadable; Deezer-sourced tracks (`ext-` prefix) are silently skipped.

### Drawer Navigation
`@react-navigation/drawer` is not used — it caused a `WorkletsError` with react-native-reanimated v4. A custom `DrawerContainer` (React context + `Animated`) replaces it. `react-native-reanimated/plugin` must remain **last** in `babel.config.js`.

### Playlist Track Indicator
Tracks highlight only when playing from the current playlist context (checked via `currentPlaylistId`). Playing from album, search, or Liked Songs correctly clears the context. Duplicate songs in a playlist are disambiguated by RNTP queue index, not by song ID.

### New Architecture
`newArchEnabled=true` in `gradle.properties` is required. `UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental` must not be called — it is incompatible with Fabric.

## Known Limitations

| Issue | Status |
|---|---|
| iOS background audio cuts | `UIBackgroundModes: audio` missing from `Info.plist` — planned post-v1.0.0 |
| iOS Dynamic Island header | `GlobalHeader` lacks safe-area insets; header partially hidden on notched devices |
| iOS distribution | Unsigned IPA only — install via AltStore or Sideloadly; no App Store planned |
| FSP swipe gesture | Removed in v1.0.0 — Android `<Modal>` + RNGH incompatibility |
