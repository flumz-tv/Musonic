## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Create playlist from Library** — new `+` button in the Library header opens a modal to create an empty playlist directly from the app.
- **Auto-download** — optional setting (disabled by default) that automatically downloads each played track to the device for offline playback. Enabling shows a confirmation warning about storage and server bandwidth usage.
- **Add ext- tracks to playlist** — Deezer tracks can now be added to playlists via the add-to-playlist sheet; OctoFiesta import is triggered automatically and Navidrome is polled until the native ID is available.

### Fixed
- **deezerFetch timeout** — all Deezer API calls now use an 8 s `AbortController` timeout, preventing Magic Shuffle and Autoplay from hanging silently on slow CDN responses.
- **Update checker version** — `LOCAL_VERSION` is now read from `package.json` at runtime instead of being hardcoded; the "check for updates" button now compares the correct installed version.
- **Offline shuffle from PlaylistDetail** — pressing Play in PlaylistDetail while Shuffle is active now applies Fisher-Yates ordering before loading the queue; previously the tracks played in order despite the shuffle indicator being lit.
- **Magic Shuffle blocked in offline mode** — cycling the shuffle button in PlaylistDetail while offline no longer reaches the `magic` state; it jumps directly from `on` back to `off`.
- **Offline shuffle in toggleShuffle** — `toggleShuffle` in the player store now resolves local file paths from `downloadStore` before building the RNTP track list, so downloaded tracks are played from the local file when shuffling offline.
- **Pending like spinner** — the heart icon in MiniPlayer and AlbumDetail now shows an `ActivityIndicator` and is disabled while a like operation is in flight, preventing double-taps.
- **toggleLike title/artist forwarding** — `toggleLike` now receives the track title and artist from MiniPlayer, SongOptionsSheet, and AlbumDetail so the ext- import poll can match the correct song.
- **Permanent error list** — `media file not found` and `local track not available` removed from `PERMANENT_ERROR_PATTERNS`; Navidrome returns these transiently before scan completes and `LikeRetryManager` handles retries correctly.
- **Search discover stale data** — switching to offline mode now resets the discover reco state to empty instead of leaving stale online data visible.
- **HTTP URL warning in ServerSetup** — an orange non-blocking warning appears under the URL field when the entered address starts with `http://`.
- **Playlist owner removed** — the hardcoded "Doodz" author line has been removed from PlaylistDetail; only track count and total duration are shown.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Like/playlist on ext- tracks** — liking or adding a Deezer track to a playlist no longer fails with "not available locally". OctoFiesta import (`stream.view`) is triggered first, then Navidrome is polled up to 75 s for the native ID before starring or adding.
- **Re-like fast path** — navidromeId is now cached in `localImportedIds` after the first successful import; subsequent unlike/re-like operations skip the full import cycle and respond immediately. Stale cache entries are evicted on star failure and fall through to a full import.
- **FSP toast visibility** — "Added to Liked" toast now appears inside the Full-Screen Player modal via a reactive `useEffect` on the `pendingLikeToast` Zustand selector, replacing an unreliable `setTimeout` approach.
- **Toast elevation** — local `Toast` component was missing `elevation: 99` on Android, causing it to render behind elevated FSP elements. Now matches `GlobalToast`.
- **PlaylistDetail like** — `handleToggleLike` in `SongRow` now reads `pendingLikeToast` after `toggleLike` resolves and shows the correct feedback message for ext- tracks.
- **Playlist instant refresh** — after adding a recommendation track the song list is updated immediately without requiring a manual refresh.
- **Recommendation pool** — reco pool expanded to 30 tracks (fetching 15 per artist); always shows 10 tracks, replacing added entries with the next track from the pool automatically. Added tracks are excluded from the pool via title+artist deduplication.
- **PlusCircleIcon design** — icon resized from 24×24 to 26×26 with strokeWidth matching MiniPlayer/FSP inline SVG style for visual consistency.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Offline mode (Beta)** — manual toggle or auto-detected via connectivity ping; settings store, offline banner, Library and PlaylistDetail adapt to offline state
- **Playlist caching** — `playlistCacheStore` persists playlist metadata and songs for offline access; download progress tracked per track
- **Track downloads** — per-track and per-playlist download to device local storage (Navidrome-indexed tracks only); MMKV-backed persistence survives app restarts
- **Download management** — delete individual downloads or full playlist batches via native confirmation dialogs across FSP, PlaylistDetail, AlbumDetail, and Library screens
- **Storage indicator** in drawer — shows total downloaded music size (Musonic usage only, in Ko/Mo/Go)
- **Autoplay** — automatic queue extension with Deezer + Navidrome similar tracks when queue ends; lock mechanism prevents parallel fetches
- **Shuffle Magic** — genre-aware third shuffle state; inserts Deezer recommendations interleaved with Navidrome tracks; isMagic flag preserved across RNTP queue operations
- **Deezer Recommendations** — Home (album cards), Search Discover (6 sections), PlaylistDetail footer, and ArtistDetail "Dans le même style" section
- **Lucide icon redesign** — all tab icons and action icons replaced with Lucide-sourced SVG variants; mask-based `TrackMagicIcon` and `CheckCircleGreenIcon` added

### Changed
- **Performance** — React.memo on QueueRow, FlashList for long lists, lazy RNTP track insertion (deferred to play time), Set-based selectedIds for edit mode
- **Reanimated migration** — SongOptionsSheet, AlbumOptionsSheet, PlaylistOptionsSheet, AddToPlaylistSheet ported to Reanimated; GestureDetector replaces PanResponder in QueueSheet, DrawerContainer, MiniPlayer, AddToPlaylistSheet handle
- **HTTP client** — `axios` removed; all API calls use native `fetch` with `AbortController` and `URLSearchParams`
- **Deezer in-memory cache** — Promise-based `artistCache` and `albumCache` prevent redundant Deezer lookups within a session
- **Audio Focus** — `RemoteDuck` handler captures playing state before ducking; only resumes if was actually playing (fixes auto-resume after alarm / Instagram / voice assistant)
- **SVG consolidation** — 22 icon components in `src/components/icons/`; inline SVG functions removed from 8 source files

### Removed
- **Dead dependencies** — `react-native-video`, `flash-list`, worklets conflict packages, `@react-native-community/new-app-screen`
- **FSP cover carousel** — swipe gesture and 3-slot carousel removed (Android `<Modal>` + RNGH incompatibility); single `CoverArt` retained with adjacent-track prefetch
- **`axios`** — replaced by native `fetch`

### Known Limitations
- **iOS audio background**: audio cuts when app is backgrounded — `UIBackgroundModes: audio` missing from `Info.plist`
- **iOS Dynamic Island**: `GlobalHeader` uses no safe-area insets; header partially hidden on notched devices
- **FSP swipe**: unavailable on Android due to RNGH + `<Modal>` incompatibility; may be revisited post-v1.0.0
- iOS build is unsigned — install via AltStore or Sideloadly; no App Store distribution planned

## [0.9.5] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Deezer recommendations in Search** — Discover tab with 6 sections: albums from liked songs, tracks from liked songs, albums from recent listens, 3 "same style" sub-sections each with artist sub-heading, horizontal album row, and track list
- **Deezer recommendations in PlaylistDetail** — footer section fetches top tracks from top 3 playlist artists; single tap plays via OctoFiesta, `+` adds to playlist
- **Deezer recommendations in Home** — Recommendations section now shows Deezer album cards from recent listened artists
- **Deezer recommendations in ArtistDetail** — "Dans le même style" section below Popular Releases; 6 related artists → enrich → deduped album cards
- **Shuffle Magic** — 3-state shuffle cycle (off → on → magic); Magic mode inserts genre-aware Deezer + Navidrome tracks into the queue
- **Autoplay** — automatic similar-track queue extension triggered by PlaybackService on last track

### Fixed
- **Audio Focus** — music no longer auto-resumes after interruptions (Instagram, alarm, Google voice) when it was paused before the interruption

### Changed
- **ArtistDetail top songs** — CoverArt added per song row; index column left-aligned

---

## [0.9.4] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Deezer public API** — artist images now fetched via `api.deezer.com/search/artist` (no API key required)
- **CI/CD GitHub Actions** — `android-release.yml` builds a signed release APK on tag push; `ios-release.yml` builds an unsigned IPA for sideloading (AltStore / Sideloadly)
- **Release keystore** — `musonic-release.keystore` (PKCS12, RSA 2048, 10 000 days); keystore path + credentials wired into `android/keystore.properties` and `build.gradle` signing config
- **Screenshots** — 13 S21 Ultra screenshots added to `docs/assets/img/screenshots/` and embedded in README

### Changed
- **Version bump** — `package.json` and `android/app/build.gradle` updated to `1.0.0` (versionCode 11)
- **README** — Last.fm section removed; Deezer integration documented; CI/CD section added; JDK requirement updated to 21; screenshots section added
- **CI workflow** — `android-release.yml` fixed: JDK 17 → 21, keystore filename aligned, `keystore.properties` now written from secrets at build time so Gradle signing config resolves correctly

### Removed
- **Last.fm integration** — `src/api/lastfm.ts` deleted; `LASTFM_API_KEY` removed from `apiKeys.example.ts`; all imports replaced by `src/api/deezer.ts`
